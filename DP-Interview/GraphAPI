GraphAPI are REST apis provided by microsoft then lets us display and modify microsoft 365 services.
We Use OAuth to login and here and the service provider is Microsoft.
After we login we will have an access token and we include this access token in every graph api calls.

After we include the access token in the header. The server check the access token and validate it.
The server will check the access token with microsoft if its calid or not. It will check for expiration.
After that the server will extract the user data and will the check for permissions.
If the user is allowed to access that graph API then the response is sent back to user.

OUTLOOK MAPPING:
Here we are displaying and modifying services with the outlook.
It mainly includes messages, calander events.
We can retrieve messages in outlook as well as the events.
A User can even have multiple calanders and he can set the primary calander for him.
There are graph api that lets us fetch events from all calanders,primmary calander, A particular calander. And events between specific time ranges.
So I have implemented this feature there where we display events.

We have written the code in backend.
We registered out backend app in AZURE and using the client ID we are adding and removing the events.
