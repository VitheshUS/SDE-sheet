Microservices are services that can be developed,deployed,scalled,debugged seperatly. They are a part of the application that are seggregated and hence they run seperatly.
Microservices are loosly coupled with another microservice and they communicate with each other through means of API calls.
They are a really cood application for encapsulation.

For example when we follow this architecture right. If one microfrontend goes down then it wont take down the whole application along with it.
The best example for microfrontend is E-commerce websites.
Where we can segregate the whole application into authentication & Authorixation service,Product service,Order Service,Coupon Service and much more based on our requirements

So lets say the ordering service goes down. But just becuase of this the application must not go down because the users must still be able to see the 
products thought they cant order it.

It may impact the users a bit its still better that taking down the whole application.

Thats why huge enterprise application follow this architecture.
