Delegates:
We apply behaviou abstraction and polymorphism right.
Like how we have an interface and multiple other objects implement that interface and we use that interface as the reference type.
Similarly we use delegate to store a method. We use this as a call back function which is similar to lambda function.

public delegate void CallBack(String message); 
Now we can use callBack as a datatype for all the methods that have similar signatures.

Eg:
public delegate void CallBack(string message);  // âœ… Delegate declaration

public class Notifier
{
    public void Notify(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Notifier notifier = new Notifier();

        // Use method group to assign the method
        CallBack handler = notifier.Notify;

        // Invoke the delegate
        handler("Hi");
    }
}

Just like java even c# generate something like a bytecode. But its not actually called a byte code.
Here we call is as an INTERMEDIATE LANGUAGE (bytecode of java)
the file will be a .dll or .exe file.

I java we have JVM that runs these but in c# we have CLR (Common language Runtime)

So the compiler is just a program. which when we want to trigger then the OS will load the compiler into the memory.
The compiler will have a set of instructions.

The OS will create all instrcuction , and all the metadata and and will load all these into the RAM along with compiler.
The CPU will now fetch these instuctions and will execute the necessary instructions. the output will then be store in the memory.
Now if we want to exectue the bytecode the OS will load the instructions into the RAM. now here we will use JVM which is also a set of program.
Now the CPU will use these instructions to unbox the bytecode to machin code which can be directly executed by the CPU.

Now lets speak about C#
it has intermediate language instead of bytecode.
CLR (Common language Runtime) instead oj JVM
intermediate language is stored as .dll or exe file.
