Interface:
Interface is a means of communication.

Lets say we have an object1 that wants to some operation on another object2.
The object1 shouldn't have complete access to object2. But few methods only. Here comes the power of interface.
We can create an interface and make object2 implement that interface. Now the we can use this interface as a datatype in object2.
Now when object1 tries to access the object2 using the interface variable. It can only call the methods declaired in that interface.
So here we are providing a means for communication using this interface.
