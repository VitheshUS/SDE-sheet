Dependency Injection :
Singletone
scoped
Transient

Singleton: 
A single instance will be shared across the application

scoped:
For one api request one instance will be created.
For example we have a e commerse application where we call by product api. Within the API we have two service that is userService and productService
Both the service has a constructor which needs dependency injection in this scenario same instance will be shared in both these services

Transient:
New instance is created for each dependency injection

When we configure any dependency Injection for example:
builder.Services.Configure<JwtOptions>(options =>builder.Configuration.GetSection("ApiSettings:JwtOptions").Bind(options));
This Dependency will be injected as IOptions<JwtOptions> jwtOptions
and we have to access the instance using jwtOptions.value
